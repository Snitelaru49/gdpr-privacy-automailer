## üß™ Limitations

- Detects only email addresses that are visible in the page text (does not parse hidden or dynamic content).
- Depends on the internal GDPR email database, which is continuously updated ‚Äî but may not cover all websites.
- Google Search fallback is manual: the user is redirected to a search query if no address is found.
- Users must manually add missing addresses to their personal database if neither the page nor the global database includes them.
